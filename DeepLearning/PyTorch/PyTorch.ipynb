    "This proceeds by first choosing a training instance, running it through your neural network, and then computing the loss of the output.  The parameters of the model are then updated by taking the derivative of the loss function.  Intuitively, if your model is completely confident in its answer, and its answer is wrong, your loss will be high.  If it is very confident in its answer, and its answer is correct, the loss will be low.\n",

For supervised multi-class classification, this means training the network to minimize the negative log probability of the correct output (or equivalently, maximize the log probability of the correct output)."

Torch provies many in the torch.optim package, and they are all completely transparent.  Using the simplest gradient update is the same as the more complicated algorithms.  Trying different update algorithms and different parameters for the update algorithms (like different initial learning rates) is important in optimizing your network's performance.

It is a model that tries to predict words given the context of a few words before and a few words after the target word.

Usually, this is referred to as *pretraining embeddings*.  It almost always helps performance a couple of percent.\n",

    "\n",
    "Pytorch is a *dynamic* neural network kit.  Another example of a dynamic kit is [Dynet](https://github.com/clab/dynet) (I mention this because working with Pytorch and Dynet is similar.  If you see an example in Dynet, it will probably help you implement it in Pytorch).  The opposite is the *static* tool kit, which includes Theano, Keras, TensorFlow, etc.\n",
    "The core difference is the following:\n",
    "* In a static toolkit, you define a computation graph once, compile it, and then stream instances to it.\n",
    "* In a dynamic toolkit, you define a computation graph *for each instance*.  It is never compiled and is executed on-the-fly\n",
    "\n",
    "Without a lot of experience, it is difficult to appreciate the difference.\n",
    "One example is to suppose we want to build a deep constituent parser.\n",
    "Suppose our model involves roughly the following steps:\n",
    "* We build the tree bottom up\n",
    "* Tag the root nodes (the words of the sentence)\n",
    "* From there, use a neural network and the embeddings of the words\n",
    "to find combinations that form constituents.  Whenever you form a new constituent,\n",
    "use some sort of technique to get an embedding of the constituent.\n",
    "In this case, our network architecture will depend completely on the input sentence.\n",
    "In the sentence \"The green cat scratched the wall\", at some point in the model, we will want to combine\n",
    "the span $(i,j,r) = (1, 3, \\text{NP})$ (that is, an NP constituent spans word 1 to word 3, in this case \"The green cat\").\n",
    "\n",
    "However, another sentence might be \"Somewhere, the big fat cat scratched the wall\".  In this sentence, we will want to form the constituent $(2, 4, NP)$ at some point.\n",
    "The constituents we will want to form will depend on the instance.  If we just compile the computation graph once, as in a static toolkit, it will be exceptionally difficult or impossible to program this logic.  In a dynamic toolkit though, there isn't just 1 pre-defined computation graph.  There can be a new computation graph for each instance, so this problem goes away.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic toolkits also have the advantage of being easier to debug and the code more closely resembling the host language (by that I mean that Pytorch and Dynet look more like actual Python code than Keras or Theano).\n",
    "\n",
    "I mention this distinction here, because the exercise in this section is to implement a model which closely resembles structure perceptron, and I believe this model would be difficult to implement in a static toolkit.  I think that the advantage of dynamic toolkits for linguistic structure prediction cannot be overstated."

The LSTM tagger above is typically sufficient for part-of-speech tagging, but a sequence model like the CRF is really essential for strong performance on NER.  Familiarity with CRF's is assumed.  Although this name sounds scary, all the model is is a CRF but where an LSTM provides the features.  This is an advanced model though, far more complicated than any earlier model in this tutorial.  If you want to skip it, that is fine.  To see if you're ready, see if you can:\n",

    "* Modify the above recurrence to compute the forward variables instead.\n",

    "\n",
    "If you can do those three things, you should be able to understand the code below.\n",
    "Recall that the CRF computes a conditional probability.  Let $y$ be a tag sequence and $x$ an input sequence of words.  Then we compute\n",
    "$$ P(y|x) = \\frac{\\exp{(\\text{Score}(x, y)})}{\\sum_{y'} \\exp{(\\text{Score}(x, y')})} $$\n",

    "$$ \\text{Score}(x,y) = \\sum_i \\log \\psi_i(x,y) $$\n",
    "To make the partition function tractable, the potentials must look only at local features.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Bi-LSTM CRF, we define two kinds of potentials: emission and transition.  The emission potential for the word at index $i$ comes from the hidden state of the Bi-LSTM at timestep $i$.  The transition scores are stored in a $|T|x|T|$ matrix $\\textbf{P}$, where $T$ is the tag set.  In my implementation, $\\textbf{P}_{j,k}$ is the score of transitioning to tag $j$ from tag $k$.  So:\n",

    "### The Forward Algorithm in Log-Space and the Log-Sum-Exp Trick\n",
    "\n",
    "As hinted at above, computing the forward variables requires using a log-sum-exp.  I want to explain why, since it was a little confusing to me at first, and many resources just present the forward algorithm in potential space.  The recurrence for the forward variable at the $i$'th word for the tag $j$, $\\alpha_i(j)$, is\n",

    "\n",
    "This is numerically unstable, and underflow is likely.  It is also inconvenient to work with proper non-negative potentials in our model.  We instead want to compute $\\log \\alpha_i(j)$.  What we need to do is to multiply the potentials, which corresponds to adding log potentials.  Then, we have to sum over tags, but what is the corresponding operation to summing over tags in log space?  It is not clear.  Instead, we need to transform out of log-space, take the product of potentials, do the sum over tags, and then transform back to log space.  This is broken down in the revised recurrence below:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\log \\alpha_i(j) = \\log \\overbrace{\\sum_{j' \\in T} \\exp{(\\log \\psi_\\text{EMIT}(j \\rightarrow i) + \\log \\psi_\\text{TRANS}(j' \\rightarrow j) + \\log \\alpha_{i-1}(j'))}}^\\text{transform out of log-space and compute forward variable} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "If you carry out elementary exponential / logarithm identities in the stuff under the overbrace above, you will see that it computes the same thing as the first recurrence, then just takes the logarithm.  Log-sum-exp appears a fair bit in machine learning, and there is a [well-known trick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LogSumExp) to computing it in a numerically stable way.  I use this trick in my log_sum_exp function below (I don't think Pytorch provides this function in its library).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "The example below implements the forward algorithm in log space to compute the partition function, and the viterbi algorithm to decode.  Backpropagation will compute the gradients automatically for us.  We don't have to do anything by hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation is not optimized.  If you understand what is going on, you'll probably quickly see that iterating over the next tag in the forward algorithm could probably be done in one big operation.  I wanted to code to be more readable.  If you want to make the relevant change, you could probably use this tagger for real tasks."

Since we have it anyway, try training the tagger where the loss function is the difference between the Viterbi path score and the score of the gold-standard path.  It should be clear that this function is non-negative and 0 when the predicted tag sequence is the correct tag sequence.  This is essentially *structured perceptron*.\n",
    "\n",
    "This modification should be short, since Viterbi and score_sentence are already implemented.  This is an example of the shape of the computation graph *depending on the training instance*.  Although I haven't tried implementing this in a static toolkit, I imagine that it is possible but much less straightforward.\n",
